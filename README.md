# Places-Visited

This is a class project to practice using constructors.  The constructor method is called to populate an object with certain properties.  

    It will need user to take an input for location.
    It will need user to take an input for landmarks.
    It will need user to take an input for season visited.
    It will need user to take an input for food locations.
    It will need user to take an input for transportation.

A user should be able to input all the fields required and an object will be created to be displayed in a hyperlink so the rest the of the properties will show.
